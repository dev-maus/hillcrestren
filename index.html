                    proceed with the project and did as what they said. There were a couple of stairs that needed
                    additional work. They brought it to our attention and gave us a reasonable price to take care of the
                    repairs. Other than being pleased with the outcome, what stood out the most was the fact that they
                    cleaned up every single day after work. It was nice not to have to deal with construction debris
                    while the stairs were being fixed."</p>

                    expectations.

                    While he worked fast and efficiently, I never felt like he was trying to cut corners. When necessary
